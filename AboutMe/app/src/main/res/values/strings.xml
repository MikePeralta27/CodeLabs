    <string name="bio">Hi, My name is Mike.
    \n\nI love traveling
    \n\nThe kind of traveling where you learn a lot about others cultures and you star to make good friends from another countries.
    \n\nI had travel to another country once in my life and this experience mark me for my whole life.
    \n\nIn that experience i med a lot a people from different countries like Americans, Romanians, Bulgarians, Mexicans, colombians and philippines.
    \n\nI mark my life so much that I want to spend my whole life traveling and knowing the world.
    \n\nOne of the more exiting experiences was the SkyDiving, my travel was for spend 4 months at the grand Canyon and I jump from a plane over there.
    \n\nThe view of the grand canyon by the sky is one of the most beautiful view in the world.
    \n\nAnd I can\'t describe how scary is the SkyDiving before jump.
    \n\n but after jump you lose the fear and you just enjoy the wind and the view in the sky. \n\n</string>
